# TimeGrapher

## Description
The TimeGrapher project is a custom-built device designed to analyze the accuracy of automatic watches. As a watch enthusiast building and selling custom timepieces with Seiko movements, I needed a reliable tool to measure deviations in timekeeping. Instead of purchasing a costly commercial TimeGrapher, I opted to create my own, combining 3D printing, custom electronics, and off-the-shelf components to deliver precise results.

## Design
The TimeGrapher consists of two primary 3D-printed bodies. The upper body acts as a holder to secure the watch and strap in place. Watches are positioned on a three-centimeter piezoelectric disc, commonly used in electric acoustic guitars, to detect mechanical vibrations. The lower body houses the electronics, features a nine-volt battery connector or power input, and includes a sensitivity adjustment knob for the piezoelectric preamplifier.

## Principle
At the heart of the TimeGrapher is the TL071 operational amplifier, which boosts the faint vibrations captured by the piezoelectric disc. These amplified signals are then routed to a microphone input or directly to a computer via a compatible sound card. The amplification ensures that the subtle ticks of the watch movement are detectable, even when standard microphones fail to pick them up.

## Processing
Using TG software for analysis, the amplified signals are processed into detailed graphs and metrics, displaying the watchâ€™s accuracy and any deviations in timing. This device allows me to fine-tune automatic movements, ensuring the watches I sell meet high reliability standards. The TimeGrapher project demonstrates the effectiveness of combining custom hardware with software for professional-grade results at a fraction of the cost.
