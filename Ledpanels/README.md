# Custom LED Panels

## Description
This project was born from my desire to enhance my room with captivating LED lighting. While exploring commercial options, I was deterred by their steep prices, often reaching hundreds of dollars. Determined to achieve a similar aesthetic, I decided to create my own custom LED panels, blending functionality with affordability. The result was a set of sleek, triangular LED panels that added vibrant, customizable lighting to my space.

## Design
I designed the LED panels from scratch, studying online resources and community forums to understand the inner workings of commercial alternatives. Each triangle is 3D-printed with a carefully crafted housing that accommodates the electronic components. Inside, I implemented custom PCBs: one for the LEDs, hosting six WS2812 LEDs in each corner, and another for connecting and distributing power and data between panels. This modular design allows the panels to be seamlessly linked together.

## Principle
The panels are powered by a five-volt system and controlled via a Bluetooth-enabled LED controller purchased online. Thanks to the WS2812 LEDs, the panels boast a range of vivid effects and animations, making them both versatile and visually stunning. The integration of reliable off-the-shelf components alongside custom engineering ensured that the project was cost-effective without sacrificing performance.

## Diffusion
To achieve a polished and professional finish, I added a frosted plexiglass diffuser, repurposed from an old LED screen. This diffuser sits snugly in a groove atop the 3D-printed housing, softening the light and masking the individual LEDs. The result is a smooth, even glow that enhances any space without revealing the technical details within. This project highlights how innovative design and resourcefulness can transform an ambitious idea into an accessible and impressive reality.
