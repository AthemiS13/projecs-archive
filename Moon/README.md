# LED Moon Project

## Description
The LED Moon Project is a meticulously crafted 3D-printed moon with a wooden stand, designed to provide ambient lighting through its 15 NeoPixel WS2812 LEDs. It is controlled via Wi-Fi using an ESP8266 module, allowing for customizable lighting via a mobile app.

## Motivation
This project was conceived as a personalized birthday gift for my girlfriend, blending technology and creativity to produce a meaningful and functional piece.

## Principle
The LED Moon features 15 individually addressable LED modules controlled by an ESP8266 microcontroller, which communicates with a mobile app via Wi-Fi. For ease of use and reliability, the project uses the Blynk platform for lighting customization. Additionally, the design includes a simple amplifier, built with two transistors and other basic components, enabling sound playback at the press of a button.
